hot cold warm cool are the functions that are applied on a String "match".

we have to reverse all the functions and apply on "match" string in reverse order to find the possible values of flag.

since all the functions are easy to reverse in nature. One function that has some particular characteristic is warm function.

it shuffles the input string in a manner. When we try to reverse the function, one single answer could not be found because length of c variable is unknown. iterating for all the possible value of c, we can find the flag.

please refer to Main.java for rev functions.

flag: flag{1ncr34s3_1n_3nth4lpy_0f_5y5}
