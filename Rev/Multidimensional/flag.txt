All the functions namely line plane space and time can be reversed.

line space and time can be reversed easily by changing the positive and negative signs.

plane function first rotates the matrix once and then perform some computation which can also be reversed by reversing the signs.
first reverse the signs and get the computation undone and then to reverse the rotation either reverse the rotation or rotate the matrix 3 more times.

also while constructing the string array, class multidimensional uses coloumn major order and checks in row major order.
remember to reverse that order too.

refer to Main.java for reversed functions.
